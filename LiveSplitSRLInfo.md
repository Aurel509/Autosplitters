#### SRL Instructions for non-irc folks:

1. Go to http://www.speedrunslive.com/channel/

2. Enter your nickname (username) and a password and hit connect

3. Once connected, enter the command: /nickserv register <password> <e-mail>

-Make sure to replace <password> with the password you want to use, and <e-mail> with your email so you can recover the account if you forget your password

4. Enter the command: /nickserv identify <password>

-This basically verifies you are who you say you are, which is the nickname you signed up with

5. Enter the command: .setstream twitch/<your channel>

-This allows SRL to track when you are online and let people watch you when you race using SRL

6. Forget about IRC

7. To join a race, right-click LiveSplit, mouse over races, and find your race at the top

-Races already in progress show here as well, and there is an option at the bottom to create a race. If you click an active race you won't join it, but be taken to the SRL page where you can view all participants and click on ones you want to watch.

8. Enter your login info in the pop-up box and hit enter

9. You should now have a small window which is technically a mini IRC client. Enter race button to enter the race, and ready checkbox to be ready.

-After particpants are all entered and ready, the race can start and will count down from 10. Since you entered using LiveSplit, when it reaches 0 your Timer will automatically start! Once your last split has been finished, it also signals to SRL that you are done. Welcome to the easy SRL life!
